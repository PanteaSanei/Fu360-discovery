Powerbank dimensions: 

    width: 26.95mm

    length: 69.59mm

    height: 132.23mm


Glossary:

    - {item}-width: the width of the actual object calculated by a caliper.

    - design-width: the width of the object in fusion model file.

    - initial-width: the width of the a line after being printed, the real print dimensions.

    - upgrade-width: the dimension to be iterated, this number is the expected dimension for the next printed  result and has to be implemented of the design file considering kerf compensations of the printer.


First version results:

    - The hanger could be more curvy on top(adding an arc despite a line in the sketch)

    - the space for the powerbank is a bit tight.(Powerbank-width: 27mm/design-width: 28.35mm/ initial-width: 26.84mm/ upgrade-width: 30mm)

    - lack of air ventilator holes on the case.

    - the gauges designed for the wire are too wide.(initial-width: 12.1mm/ upgrade-width: 6mm)

    - the winder will be improved if it will be an in-place rotating joint instead of a removable one!

    - the winder is too loose inside the hole(too much off-set)

    - The lid is too loose and it will be improved by having two hangers under the lid-groove to get into the gauges and then fit under the lid grooves to prevent the door from opening.
    
    - The print can be improved by modularization, the spinner could be a seperated part with four joints as well as a similar approach for the hanger.
